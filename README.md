We're going to download and install oracle virtualbox which is what we're going to use to run our virtual machines on after that's installed we're going to download a windows 10 iso and a server 2019 iso that we're going to use to install the two operating systems on two separate virtual machines next after we have everything downloaded and installed we're going to create our first virtual machine which is going to be our domain controller which is going to house active directory we're going to give this virtual machine two network adapters one is going to be used to connect to the outside internet and the other one that's going to be used to connect to the virtual box kind of private network that the clients are going to connect to after our virtual machine is created we're going to install server 2019 on it and then we're going to assign ip addressing for the internal network the external network will automatically get ip addressing from your home network or like your home router so we don't have to worry about it after we have ip addressing setup we're going to name the server and then we're going to install active directory and create our domain then we're going to configure that and routing so the clients on the private network can reach the internet through the domain controller next we're going to set up a dhcp on the domain controller so when we create our windows 10 machine it can automatically get an ip address and then the last thing we do on the domain controller before we create our client virtual machine is we're going to run a powershell script that will automatically create a thousand users in active directory and i'll kind of go through the script a little bit to explain what each line is so you can kind of get an intuition on how powershell is useful and like what kind of things you can use it for after creating the users we're going to create another virtual machine and install windows 10 on it and that virtual machine will be connected to the private virtual box network we're going to name that machine client1 and join it to the domain and then we're going to log into it with one of our domain accounts at this point our tutorial is going to be pretty much concluded so this environment we're building is a pretty basic windows networking environment with active directory and then just a few networking services
